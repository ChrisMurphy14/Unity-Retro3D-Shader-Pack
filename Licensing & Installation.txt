Installation - Unity's Post-Processing Package:
The post-processing shader included in the pack requires Unity's Post-Processing Stack system (https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.3/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessing-Stack.html). If this package is not already included in your Unity project, a bunch of errors will appear after importing the Retro Shader Pack.

To install the current version (v2) of the Post-Processing Stack:
- Open the Package Manager via the 'Window' menu at the top of the screen
- By default the Package Manager will only display packages currently included in the project - to show all available packages, click on the 'Packages: In Project' dropdown in the top left of the window and change it to 'Packages: Unity Registry'
- Scroll down the alphabetically-ordered list, select the 'Post-Processing' package, and press 'Import' 


Installation - Text Mesh Pro (TMP):
The Example Scene included in the Retro Shader pack requires Text Mesh Pro to be installed in order to display the included 3D text objects. A prompt will automatically appear when opening the Example Scene for the first time, simply select 'Import TMP Essentials' to install.



How To Use:
All non-post-processing shaders included in the package can be used once the folder has been imported into a Unity project. To apply one of these shaders to a material:
- Select the material in the project window
- Click the drop-down Shader menu at the top of the Inspector window
- Select 'Retro 3D Shader Pack/<preferred shader>

See the 'Setting up the post-processing stack' webpage (https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.3/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessing-Stack-SetUp.html) on how to configure a scene to use the retro post-processing shader. You can either use the supplied Retro Post-processing Profile used within the Example Scene or create your own if you want to include extra post-processing effects.
