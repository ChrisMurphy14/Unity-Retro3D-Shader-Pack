- Retro properties which can be easily enabled and disabled including;
	- Vertex jitter/snapping with world/screen space toggle
	- Affine texture mapping
	- Vertex draw distance
- Lit and unlit sprite shaders
- Retro post-processing shader which uses the in-built Unity Post-Processing Stack (v2) for simple integration with other post-process effects as well as enabling;
	- Pixelation which can be toggled between basic pixel scaling vs fixed vertical resolution
	- Color depth/posterization
	- Scalable dithering which comes with a set of supplied dither patterns as well as the option to use your own
- Demonstration scene showcasing the practical use of each shader with example materials and post-processing profile
